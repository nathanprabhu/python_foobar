When it rains it pours
======================

It's raining, it's pouring. You and your agents are nearing the building where
the captive rabbits are being held, but a sudden storm puts your escape plans at
risk.

The structural integrity of the rabbit hutches you've built to house the
fugitive rabbits is at risk because they can buckle when wet. Before the rabbits
can be rescued from Professor Boolean's lab, you must compute how much standing
water has accumulated on the rabbit hutches.

Specifically, suppose there is a line of hutches, stacked to various heights and
water is poured from the top (and allowed to run off the sides). We'll assume
all the hutches are square, have side length 1, and for the purposes of this
problem we'll pretend that the hutch arrangement is two-dimensional.

For example, suppose the heights of the stacked hutches are [1,4,2,5,1,2,3]:

...X...
.X.X...
.X.X..X
.XXX.XX
XXXXXXX
1425123

When water is poured over the top at all places and allowed to runoff,
it will remain trapped at the 'O' locations:

...X...
.XOX...
.XOXOOX
.XXXOXX
XXXXXXX
1425123

The amount of water that has accumulated is the number of Os,
which, in this instance, is 5.

Write a function called answer(heights) which, given the heights of the stacked
hutches from left-to-right as a list, computes the total area of standing water
accumulated as water is poured from the top and allowed to run off the sides.

The heights array will have at least 1 element and at most 9000 elements.
Each element will have a value of at least 1, and at most 100000.

    I've tried my best to solve this problem using formulas and logic
    but all my scribbles and calculations keep getting ruined in the rain.

    A decision was made to employ the services of a local water rat (Pete) who
    was also trapped in the lab. We made a deal that if we set him free, he will
    help us calculate how much standing water there is so we can all escape.

    He spends a couple of minutes formulating his plan, pacing around the room:

        - Climb to the top of the first column and find next hutch above water.
        - Count the depth he dives to as he's swimming along to that hutch.
        - Sum the difference between the depths and the water's surface level.

        Eg.

           X
        X  X   X
        X XX X X
        XXXXXX X
        XXXXXXXX
        42352314

        --------------------

        Pete -->    P  X
                    X  X   X
                    X XX X X
                    XXXXXX X
                    XXXXXXXX    Total = 0

        Then dives into the water, counting how deep he goes for each column.
        Counts 2 and 1 before he comes back up and climbs up at target = 3.

                       X
                    XPPX   X
                    XPXX X X
                    XXXXXX X
                    XXXXXXXX

                       P
                       X
                    XOOX   X
                    XOXX X X
                    XXXXXX X
                    XXXXXXXX    Total =  0 + 3

        He looks ahead to find either a column at his current height or higher,
        or simply the highest column he can see.

        In this case it's the last one at target = 7.

        He dives in at a surface level of 4 (min(h[current], h[target])).
        He counts 2, 1 and 3 before he breaches the surface at the last column.

        He can see that there are no more hutches ahead or below him - all done.
